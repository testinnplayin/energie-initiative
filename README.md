This is a Thinkful capstone project for the Frontend Web Development course. It asks us to design a web application that uses at least one API to present data in at least a somewhat useful way. For this project, two APIs were used, though one of them had two "mini-APIs" that were used. The first one is that of the French government's open data project found at https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/. The part we used was for green initiative proposals published in 2015 on the site www.votreenergiepourlafrance.fr. This website is a place where people with ideas come and publish proposals on various different environmental themes. The author of this web app thought it might be useful to visualize that data on a map and show a breakdown of the number of initiatives proposed by theme. These initiatives are also drawn up from the data so that interested users can go to the articles and read them directly on the government's website.
The second API is the map and chart drawing API called ammcharts found at https://www.amcharts.com/. 
Region names changed between 2015 and 2016 in France. We decided to let users use either the old names or the new names. However, data is not shown only for the old regions, just for the new regions at the moment. The region known as Mayotte has no published proposal for the year of interest.
The second issue at the moment is that the DOM-TOM (French Polynesia) is not represented yet on the map since ammaps doesn't offer it directly with the map of mainland France and we haven't come up with a great solution to show it just yet. This issue will be hopefully soon resolved.
